Thanks for many interests of HexPlane on iPhone dataset. And really sorry for the inconvenience of not providing the iphone dataloader code in the github. 

Currently, Hexplane works well on several scenes of iphone dataset while works badly on some others. There are consistently several objects in the reconstructed scenes, which makes me less confident the data loader is actually correct. Because of so many inquiry emails, I put the code [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1hkSVyy05f1pP4sDJSjqNFUobpkSVGT_g/view?usp=sharing) Please not the code might be potentially wrong.
